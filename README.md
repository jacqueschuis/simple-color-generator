Simple color generator

Following along with Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022, there was a project about building a simple RGB color generator. As someone who prefers to work with hex colors, I decided to expand on this to make a simple app that generates a random RGB or hex color and can translate between these two formats for user preference. I've also used javascript to change the coloring of the page depending on the random color, which also generates a light and dark variant to make a monochromatic color scheme.
